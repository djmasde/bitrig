.Sh DESCRIPTION
This manual page describes the
.Nm zlib
general purpose compression library, version 1.2.8.
.Pp
The
.Nm zlib
compression library provides in-memory compression and decompression functions,
including integrity checks of the uncompressed data. This version of the
library supports only one compression method
.Pq deflation
but other algorithms will be added later and will have the same stream
interface.
.Pp
Compression can be done in a single step if the buffers are large enough, or
can be done by repeated calls of the compression function. In the latter case,
the application must provide more input and/or consume the output
.Pq providing more output space
before each call.
.Pp
The compressed data format used by default by the in-memory functions is the
.Nm zlib
format, which is a zlib wrapper documented in RFC 1950, wrapped around a
deflate stream, which is itself documented in RFC 1951.
.Pp
The library also supports reading and writing files in
.Xr gzip 1
.Pq .gz
format with an interface similar to that of
.Xr stdio 3
using the functions that start with
.Qq gz .
The gzip format is different from the zlib format. gzip is a gzip wrapper,
documented in RFC 1952, wrapped around a deflate stream. This library can
optionally read and write gzip streams in memory as well.
.Pp
The zlib format was designed to be compact and fast for use in memory and on
communications channels. The gzip format was designed for single-file
compression on file systems, has a larger header than zlib to maintain
directory information, and uses a different, slower, check method than zlib.
.Pp
The library does not install any signal handler. The decoder checks the
consistency of the compressed data, so the library should never crash even in
case of corrupted input.
.Pp
The functions within the library are divided into the following sections:

.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo
.Ft const char *
.Fn zlibVersion "void" ;
.Xc
.Pp
The application can compare
.Fn zlibVersion
and
.Dv ZLIB_VERSION
for consistency. If the first character differs, the library code actually used
is not compatible with the
.Aq Pa zlib.h
header file used by the application. This check is automatically made by
.Fn deflateInit
and
.Fn inflateInit .
.It Xo
.Ft int
.Fn deflateInit "z_streamp strm" "int level" ;
.Xc
.Pp
The
.Fn deflateInit
function initializes the internal stream state for compression. The fields
.Va zalloc ,
.Va zfree ,
and
.Va opaque
must be initialized before by the caller. If
.Va zalloc
and
.Va zfree
are set to
.Dv Z_NULL ,
.Fn deflateInit
updates them to use default allocation functions.
.Pp
The compression level must be
.Dv Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION ,
or between 0 and 9:
1 gives best speed, 9 gives best compression, 0 gives no compression at all
.Pq the input data is simply copied a block at a time .
.Pp
.Dv Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION
requests a default compromise between speed and compression
.Pq currently equivalent to level 6 .
.Pp
.Fn deflateInit
returns
.Dv Z_OK
if successful,
.Dv Z_MEM_ERROR
if there was not enough memory,
.Dv Z_STREAM_ERROR
if
.Fa level
is not a valid compression level, or
.Dv Z_VERSION_ERROR
if the
.Nm zlib
library version
.Pq zlib_version
is incompatible with the version assumed by the caller
.Pq ZLIB_VERSION .
.Va msg
is set to null if there is no error message.
.Fn deflateInit
does not perform any compression: this will be done by
.Fn deflate .
.It Xo
.Ft int
.Fn deflate "z_streamp strm" "int flush" ;
.Xc
.Pp
.Fn deflate
compresses as much data as possible, and stops when the input buffer becomes
empty or the output buffer becomes full. It may introduce some output latency
.Pq reading input without producing any output
except when forced to flush.
.Pp
The detailed semantics are as follows.
.Fn deflate
performs one or both of the following actions:
.Pp
Compress more input starting at
.Va next_in
and update
.Va next_in
and
.Va avail_in
accordingly.
If not all input can be processed
.Pq because there is not enough room in the output buffer ,
.Va next_in
and
.Va avail_in
are updated and processing will resume at this point for the next call to
.Fn deflate .
.Pp
Provide more output starting at
.Va next_out
and update
.Va next_out
and
.Va avail_out
accordingly. This action is forced if the parameter
.Fa flush
is non-zero. Forcing
.Fa flush
frequently degrades the compression ratio, so this parameter should be set only
when necessary
.Pq in interactive applications .
Some output may be provided even if
.Fa flush
is not set.
.Pp
Before the call to
.Fn deflate ,
the application should ensure that at least one of the actions is possible, by
providing more input and/or consuming more output, and updating
.Va avail_in
or
.Va avail_out
accordingly;
.Va avail_out
should never be zero before the call. The application can consume the
compressed output when it wants, for example when the output buffer is full
.Pq avail_out == 0 ,
or after each call to
.Fn deflate .
If
.Fn deflate
returns
.Dv Z_OK
and with zero
.Va avail_out ,
it must be called again after making room in the output buffer because there
might be more output pending.
.Pp
Normally the parameter
.Fa flush
is set to
.Dv Z_NO_FLUSH ,
which allows
.Fn deflate
to decide how much data to accumulate before producing output, in order to
maximise compression.
.Pp
If the parameter
.Fa flush
is set to
.Dv Z_SYNC_FLUSH ,
all pending output is flushed to the output buffer and the output is aligned on
a byte boundary, so that the decompressor can get all input data available so
far.
.Po
In particular,
.Va avail_in
is zero after the call if enough output space has been provided before the
call.
.Pc
Flushing may degrade compression for some compression algorithms and so it
should be used only when necessary. This completes the current deflate block
and follows it with an empty stored block that is three bits plus filler bits
to the next byte, followed by four bytes
.Pq 00 00 ff ff .
.Pp
If flush is set to
.Dv Z_PARTIAL_FLUSH ,
all pending output is flushed to the output buffer, but the output is not
aligned to a byte boundary. All of the input data so far will be available to
the decompressor, as for
.Dv Z_SYNC_FLUSH .
This completes the current deflate block and follows it with an empty fixed
codes block that is 10 bits long. This assures that enough bytes are output in
order for the decompressor to finish the block before the empty fixed code
block.
.Pp
If flush is set to
.Dv Z_BLOCK ,
a deflate block is completed and emitted, as for
.Dv Z_SYNC_FLUSH ,
but the output is not aligned on a byte boundary, and up to seven bits of the
current block are held to be written as the next byte after the next deflate
block is completed. In this case, the decompressor may not be provided enough
bits at this point in order to complete decompression of the data provided so
far to the compressor. It may need to wait for the next block to be emitted.
This is for advanced applications that need to control the emission of deflate
blocks.
.Pp
If
.Fa flush
is set to
.Dv Z_FULL_FLUSH ,
all output is flushed as with
.Dv Z_SYNC_FLUSH ,
and the compression state is reset so that decompression can restart from this
point if previous compressed data has been damaged or if random access is
desired. Using
.Dv Z_FULL_FLUSH
too often can seriously degrade compression.
.Pp
If
.Fn deflate
returns with avail_out == 0, this function must be called again with the same
value of the
.Fa flush
parameter and more output space
.Po
updated
.va avail_out
.Pc ,
until the flush is complete
.Po
.Fn deflate
returns with non-zero
.Va avail_out
.Pc .
In the case of a
.Dv Z_FULL_FLUSH
or a
.Dv Z_SYNC_FLUSH ,
make sure that
.Va avail_out
is greater than six to avoid repeated flush markers due to avail_out == 0 on
return.
.Pp
If the parameter
.Fa flush
is set to
.Dv Z_FINISH ,
pending input is processed, pending output is flushed and
.Fn deflate
returns with
.Dv Z_STREAM_END
if there was enough output space; if
.Fn deflate
returns with
.Dv Z_OK ,
this function must be called again with
.Dv Z_FINISH
and more output space
.Po
updated
.Va avail_out
.Pc
but no more input data, until it returns with
.Dv Z_STREAM_END
or an error.
After
.Fn deflate
has returned
.Dv Z_STREAM_END ,
the only possible operations on the stream are
.Fn deflateReset
or
.Fn deflateEnd .
.Pp
.Dv Z_FINISH
can be used immediately after
.Fn deflateInit
if all the compression is to be done in a single step.
In this case,
.Va avail_out
must be at least the value returned by
.Fn deflateBound
.Pq see below .
Then deflate is guaranteed to return Z_STREAM_END. If not enough output space
is provided,
.Fn deflate
will not return
.Dv Z_STREAM_END ,
and it must be called again as described above.
.Pp
.Fn deflate
sets strm-\*(Gtadler to the Adler-32 checksum of all input read so far
.Po
that is,
.Va total_in
bytes
.Pc .
.Pp
.Fn deflate
may update strm-\*(Gtdata_type
if it can make a good guess about the input data type
.Pq Z_BINARY or Z_TEXT .
If in doubt, the data is considered binary.
This field is only for information purposes and does not affect
the compression algorithm in any manner.
.Pp
.Fn deflate
returns
.Dv Z_OK
if some progress has been made
.Pq more input processed or more output produced ,
.Dv Z_STREAM_END
if all input has been consumed and all output has been produced
.Po
only when
.Fa flush
is set to
.Dv Z_FINISH
.Pc ,
.Dv Z_STREAM_ERROR
if the stream state was inconsistent
.Po
for example, if
.va next_in
or
.Va next_out
was
.Dv Z_NULL
.Pc ,
.Dv Z_BUF_ERROR
if no progress is possible
.Po
for example,
.Va avail_in
or
.Va avail_out
was zero
.Pc .
Note that
.Dv Z_BUF_ERROR
is not fatal, and
.Fn deflate
can be called again with more input and more output space
to continue processing.
.It Xo
.Ft int
.Fn deflateEnd "z_streamp strm" ;
.Xc
.Pp
All dynamically allocated data structures for this stream are freed.
This function discards any unprocessed input and does not flush any
pending output.
.Pp
.Fn deflateEnd
returns
.Dv Z_OK
if successful,
.Dv Z_STREAM_ERROR
if the stream state was inconsistent,
.Dv Z_DATA_ERROR
if the stream was freed prematurely
.Pq some input or output was discarded .
In the error case,
.Va msg
may be set but then points to a static string
.Pq which must not be deallocated .
.It Xo
.Ft int
.Fn inflateInit "z_streamp strm" ;
.Xc
The
.Fn inflateInit
function initializes the internal stream state for decompression.
The fields
.Va next_in ,
.Va avail_in ,
.Va zalloc ,
.Va zfree ,
and
.Va opaque
must be initialized before by the caller.
If
.Va next_in
is not
.Dv Z_NULL
and
.Va avail_in
is large enough
.Pq the exact value depends on the compression method ,
.Fn inflateInit
determines the compression method from the
.Nm zlib
header and allocates all data structures accordingly;
otherwise the allocation will be deferred to the first call to
.Fn inflate .
If
.Va zalloc
and
.Va zfree
are set to
.Dv Z_NULL ,
.Fn inflateInit
updates them to use default allocation functions.
.Pp
.Fn inflateInit
returns
.Dv Z_OK
if successful,
.Dv Z_MEM_ERROR
if there was not enough memory,
.Dv Z_VERSION_ERROR
if the
.Nm zlib
library version is incompatible with the version assumed by the caller, or
.Dv Z_STREAM_ERROR
if the parameters are invalid, such as a null pointer to the structure.
.Va msg
is set to null if there is no error message.
.Fn inflateInit
does not perform any decompression apart from possibly reading the
.Nm zlib
header if present: actual decompression will be done by
.Fn inflate .
.Po
So
.Va next_in
and
.Va avail_in
may be modified,
but
.Va next_out
and
.Va avail_out
are unused and unchanged.
.Pc
The current implementation of
.Fn inflateInit
does not process any header information -- that is deferred until
.Fn inflate
is called.
.It Xo
.Ft int
.Fn inflate "z_streamp strm" "int flush" ;
.Xc
.Fn inflate
decompresses as much data as possible, and stops when the input
buffer becomes empty or the output buffer becomes full.
It may introduce some output latency
.Pq reading input without producing any output
except when forced to flush.
.Pp
The detailed semantics are as follows.
.Fn inflate
performs one or both of the following actions:
.Pp
Decompress more input starting at
.Va next_in
and update
.Va next_in
and
.Va avail_in
accordingly.
If not all input can be processed
.Pq because there is not enough room in the output buffer ,
.Va next_in
is updated and processing will resume at this point for the next call to
.Fn inflate .
.Pp
Provide more output starting at
.Va next_out
and update
.Va next_out
and
.Va avail_out
accordingly.
.Fn inflate
provides as much output as possible,
until there is no more input data or no more space in the output buffer
.Pq see below about the flush parameter .
.Pp
Before the call to
.Fn inflate ,
the application should ensure that at least one of the actions is possible,
by providing more input and/or consuming more output,
and updating the next_* and avail_* values accordingly.
The application can consume the uncompressed output when it wants,
for example when the output buffer is full
.Pq avail_out == 0 ,
or after each call to
.Fn inflate .
If
.Fn inflate
returns
.Dv Z_OK
and with zero
.Va avail_out ,
it must be called again after making room
in the output buffer because there might be more output pending.
.Pp
The
.Fa flush
parameter of
.Fn inflate
can be
.Dv Z_NO_FLUSH , Z_SYNC_FLUSH , Z_FINISH , Z_BLOCK
or
.Dv Z_TREES .
.Dv Z_SYNC_FLUSH
requests that
.Fn inflate
flush as much output as possible to the output buffer.
.Dv Z_BLOCK
requests that
.Fn inflate
stop if and when it gets to the next deflate block boundary.
When decoding the zlib or gzip format, this will cause
.Fn inflate
to return immediately after the header and before the first block.
When doing a raw inflate,
.Fn inflate
will go ahead and process the first block,
and will return when it gets to the end of that block,
or when it runs out of data.
.Pp
The
.Dv Z_BLOCK
option assists in appending to or combining deflate streams.
Also to assist in this, on return
.Fn inflate
will set strm-\*(Gtdata_type to the number of unused bits in the last byte
taken from strm-\*(Gtnext_in, plus 64 if
.Fn inflate
is currently decoding the last block in the deflate stream, plus 128 if
.Fn inflate
returned immediately after decoding an end-of-block code or decoding
the complete header up to just before the first byte of the deflate stream.
The end-of-block will not be indicated until all of the uncompressed data
from that block has been written to strm-\*(Gtnext_out.
The number of unused bits may in general be greater than seven,
except when bit 7 of data_type is set,
in which case the number of unused bits will be less than eight.
.Va data_type
is set as noted here every time
.Fn inflate
returns for all flush options, and so can be used to determine the amount of
currently consumed input in bits.
.Pp
The
.Dv Z_TREES
option behaves as
.Dv Z_BLOCK
does, but it also returns when the end of each deflate block header is reached,
before any actual data in that block is decoded. This allows the caller to
determine the length of the deflate block header for later use in random access
within a deflate block. 256 is added to the value of
.Va strm-\*(Gtdata_type
when
.Fn inflate
returns immediately after reaching the end of the deflate block header.
.Pp
.Fn inflate
should normally be called until it returns
.Dv Z_STREAM_END
or an error.
However if all decompression is to be performed in a single step
.Pq a single call to inflate ,
the parameter
.Fa flush
should be set to
.Dv Z_FINISH .
In this case all pending input is processed and all pending output is flushed;
.Va avail_out
must be large enough to hold all of the uncompressed data for the operation to
complete.
.Po
The size of the uncompressed data may have been saved by the compressor for
this purpose.
.Pc
The use of
.Dv Z_FINISH
is not required to perform an inflation in one step. However it may be used to
inform
.Fn inflate
that a faster approach can be used for the single
.Fn inflate
call.
.Dv Z_FINISH
also informs inflate to not maintain a sliding window if the stream completes,
which reduces inflate's memory footprint. If the stream does not complete,
either because not all of the stream is provided or not enough output space is
provided, then a sliding window will be allocated and
.Fn inflate
can be called again to continue the operation as if
.Dv Z_NO_FLUSH
had been used.
.Pp
In this implementation,
.Fn inflate
always flushes as much output as possible to the output buffer,
and always uses the faster approach on the first call.
So the effects of the
.Fa flush
parameter in this implementation are on the return value of
.Fn inflate
as noted below, when 
.Fn inflate
returns early when
.Dv Z_BLOCK
or
.Dv Z_TREES
is used, and when
.Fn inflate
avoids the allocation of memory for a sliding window when
.Dv Z_FINISH
is used.
.Pp
If a preset dictionary is needed after this call
.Po
see
.Fn inflateSetDictionary
below
.Pc ,
.Fn inflate
sets strm-\*(Gtadler to the Adler-32 checksum of the dictionary
chosen by the compressor and returns Z_NEED_DICT; otherwise it sets
strm-\*(Gtadler to the Adler-32 checksum of all output produced so far
.Po
that is,
.Va total_out
bytes
.Pc
and returns
.Dv Z_OK , Z_STREAM_END
or an error code as described below.
At the end of the stream,
.Fn inflate
checks that its computed Adler-32 checksum is equal to that saved by
the compressor and returns
.Dv Z_STREAM_END
only if the checksum is correct.
.Pp
.Fn inflate
can decompress and check either zlib-wrapped or gzip-wrapped deflate data.
The header type is detected automatically, if requested when initializing with
.Fn inflateInit2 .
Any information contained in the gzip header is not retained,
so applications that need that information should instead use raw inflate; see
.Fn inflateInit2
below, or
.Fn inflateBack
and perform their own processing of the gzip header and trailer. When
processing gzip-wrapped deflate data, strm-\*(Gtadler32 is set to the CRC-32 of
the output producted so far. The CRC-32 is checked against the gzip trailer.
.Pp
.Fn inflate
returns
.Dv Z_OK
if some progress has been made
.Pq more input processed or more output produced ,
.Dv Z_STREAM_END
if the end of the compressed data has been reached and all uncompressed output
has been produced,
.Dv Z_NEED_DICT
if a preset dictionary is needed at this point,
.Dv Z_DATA_ERROR
if the input data was corrupted
.Po
input stream not conforming to the
.Nm zlib
format or incorrect check value
.Pc ,
.Dv Z_STREAM_ERROR
if the stream structure was inconsistent
.Po
for example
.Va next_in
or
.va next_out
was
.Dv Z_NULL
.Pc ,
.Dv Z_MEM_ERROR
if there was not enough memory,
.Dv Z_BUF_ERROR
if no progress is possible or if there was not enough room in the output buffer
when
.Dv Z_FINISH
is used.
Note that
.Dv Z_BUF_ERROR
is not fatal, and
.Fn inflate
can be called again with more input and more output space
to continue compressing.
If
.Dv Z_DATA_ERROR
is returned, the application may then call
.Fn inflateSync
to look for a good compression block if a partial recovery
of the data is desired.

This function discards any unprocessed input and does not flush any
pending output.
.Pp
.Fn inflateEnd
returns
.Dv Z_OK
if successful, or
.Dv Z_STREAM_ERROR
if the stream state was inconsistent.
In the error case,
.Va msg
may be set but then points to a static string
.Pq which must not be deallocated .

.Sh ADVANCED FUNCTIONS
The following functions are needed only in some special applications.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo
.Ft int
.Fn deflateInit2 "z_streamp strm" "int level" "int method" "int windowBits" "int memLevel" "int strategy" ;
.Xc
.Pp
This is another version of
.Fn deflateInit
with more compression options.
The fields
.Va next_in ,
.Va zalloc ,
.Va zfree ,
and
.Va opaque
must be initialized before by the caller.
.Pp
The
.Fa method
parameter is the compression method.
It must be
.Dv Z_DEFLATED
in this version of the library.
.Pp
The
.Fa windowBits
parameter is the base two logarithm of the window size
.Pq the size of the history buffer .
It should be in the range 8..15 for this version of the library.
Larger values of this parameter result in better compression
at the expense of memory usage.
The default value is 15 if
.Fn deflateInit
is used instead.
.Pp
.Fa windowBits
can also be \-8..\-15 for raw deflate.
In this case, -windowBits determines the window size.
.Fn deflate
will then generate raw deflate data with no zlib header or trailer,
and will not compute an Adler-32 check value.
.Pp
.Fa windowBits
can also be greater than 15 for optional gzip encoding.
Add 16 to
.Fa windowBits
to write a simple gzip header and trailer around the
compressed data instead of a zlib wrapper.
The gzip header will have no file name, no extra data, no comment,
no modification time
.Pq set to zero ,
no header crc, and the operating system will be set to 255
.Pq unknown .
If a gzip stream is being written,
strm-\*(Gtadler is a crc32 instead of an adler32.
.Pp
The
.Fa memLevel
parameter specifies how much memory should be allocated
for the internal compression state.
memLevel=1 uses minimum memory but is slow and reduces compression ratio;
memLevel=9 uses maximum memory for optimal speed.
The default value is 8.
See
.Aq Pa zconf.h
for total memory usage as a function of
.Fa windowBits
and
.Fa memLevel .
.Pp
The
.Fa strategy
parameter is used to tune the compression algorithm.
Use the value
.Dv Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY
for normal data;
.Dv Z_FILTERED
for data produced by a filter
.Pq or predictor ;
.Dv Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY
to force Huffman encoding only
.Pq no string match ,
or
.Dv Z_RLE
to limit match distances to one
.Pq run-length encoding .
Filtered data consists mostly of small values with a
somewhat random distribution.
In this case, the compression algorithm is tuned to compress them better.
The effect of
.Dv Z_FILTERED
is to force more Huffman coding and less string matching;
it is somewhat intermediate between
.Dv Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY
and
.Dv Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY .
.Dv Z_RLE
is designed to be almost as fast as
.Dv Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY ,
but gives better compression for PNG image data.
The
.Fa strategy
parameter only affects the compression ratio but not the correctness of the
compressed output, even if it is not set appropriately.
.Dv Z_FIXED
prevents the use of dynamic Huffman codes,
allowing for a simpler decoder for special applications.
.Pp
.Fn deflateInit2
returns
.Dv Z_OK
if successful,
.Dv Z_MEM_ERROR
if there was not enough memory,
.Dv Z_STREAM_ERROR
if any parameter is invalid
.Pq such as an invalid method ,
or
.Dv Z_VERSION_ERROR if the zlib library version
.Pq zlib_version
is incompatible with the version assumed by the caller
.Po
.Dv ZLIB_VERSION
.Pc .
.Va msg
is set to null if there is no error message.
.Fn deflateInit2
does not perform any compression: this will be done by
.Fn deflate .
.It Xo
.Ft int
.Fn deflateSetDictionary "z_streamp strm" "const Bytef *dictionary" "uInt dictLength" ;
.Xc
.Pp
Initializes the compression dictionary from the given byte sequence
without producing any compressed output.
When using the zlib format, this function must be called immediately after
.Fn deflateInit ,
.Fn deflateInit2 ,
or
.Fn deflateReset ,
and before any call to
.Fn deflate .
When doing raw deflate, this function must be called either before any call of
.Fn deflate ,
or immediately after the completion of a deflate block, i.e. after all input has been
consumed and all output has been delivered when using any of the flush
options
.Dv Z_BLOCK ,
.Dv Z_PARTIAL_FLUSH ,
.Dv Z_SYNC_FLUSH ,
or
.Dv Z_FULL_FLUSH .
The compressor and decompressor must use exactly the same dictionary
.Po
see
.Fn inflateSetDictionary
.Pc .
.Pp
The dictionary should consist of strings
.Pq byte sequences
that are likely to be encountered later in the data to be compressed,
with the most commonly used strings preferably put towards
the end of the dictionary.
Using a dictionary is most useful when the data to be compressed is short
and can be predicted with good accuracy;
the data can then be compressed better than with the default empty dictionary.
.Pp
Depending on the size of the compression data structures selected by
.Fn deflateInit
or
.Fn deflateInit2 ,
a part of the dictionary may in effect be discarded,
for example if the dictionary is larger than the window size provided in
.Fn deflateInit
or
.Fn deflateInit2 .
Thus the strings most likely to be useful should be
put at the end of the dictionary, not at the front.
In addition, the current implementation of
.Fn deflate
will use at most the window size minus 262 bytes of the provided dictionary.
.Pp
Upon return of this function, strm-\*(Gtadler is set to the Adler-32 value
of the dictionary; the decompressor may later use this value to determine
which dictionary has been used by the compressor.
.Po
The Adler-32 value applies to the whole dictionary even if only a subset of the
dictionary is actually used by the compressor.
.Pc
If a raw deflate was requested, then the Adler-32 value is not computed and
strm-\*(Gtadler is not set.
.Pp
.Fn deflateSetDictionary
returns
.Dv Z_OK
if successful,
or
.Dv Z_STREAM_ERROR
if a parameter is invalid
.Po
e.g. dictionary being
.Dv Z_NULL
.Pc
or the stream state is inconsistent
.Po
for example if
.Fn deflate
has already been called for this stream or not at a block boundary for raw
deflate
.Pc .
.Fn deflateSetDictionary
does not perform any compression: this will be done by
.Fn deflate .
.It Xo
.Ft int
.Fn deflateCopy "z_streamp dest" "z_streamp source" ;
.Xc
.Pp
The
.Fn deflateCopy
function sets the destination stream as a complete copy of the source stream.
.Pp
This function can be useful when several compression strategies will be
tried, for example when there are several ways of pre-processing the input
data with a filter.
The streams that will be discarded should then be freed by calling
.Fn deflateEnd .
Note that
.Fn deflateCopy
duplicates the internal compression state which can be quite large,
so this strategy is slow and can consume lots of memory.
.Pp
.Fn deflateCopy
returns
.Dv Z_OK
if successful,
.Dv Z_MEM_ERROR
if there was not enough memory,
.Dv Z_STREAM_ERROR
if the source stream state was inconsistent
.Po
such as
.Va zalloc
being
.Dv Z_NULL
.Pc .
.Va msg
is left unchanged in both source and destination.
.It Xo
.Ft int
.Fn deflateReset "z_streamp strm" ;
.Xc
.Pp
This function is equivalent to
.Fn deflateEnd
followed by
.Fn deflateInit ,
but does not free and reallocate all the internal compression state.
The stream will keep the same compression level and any other attributes
that may have been set by
.Fn deflateInit2 .
.Pp
.Fn deflateReset
returns
.Dv Z_OK
if successful, or
.Dv Z_STREAM_ERROR
if the source stream state was inconsistent
.Po
such as
.Va zalloc
or
.Va state
being
.Dv Z_NULL
.Pc .
.It Xo
.Ft int
.Fn deflateParams "z_streamp strm" "int level" "int strategy" ;
.Xc
.Pp
The
.Fn deflateParams
function dynamically updates the compression level and compression strategy.
The interpretation of level and strategy is as in
.Fn deflateInit2 .
This can be used to switch between compression and straight copy
of the input data, or to switch to a different kind of input data
requiring a different strategy.
If the compression level is changed, the input available so far
is compressed with the old level
.Pq and may be flushed ;
the new level will take effect only at the next call to
.Fn deflate .
.Pp
Before the call to
.Fn deflateParams ,
the stream state must be set as for a call to
.Fn deflate ,
since the currently available input may have to be compressed and flushed.
In particular, strm-\*(Gtavail_out must be non-zero.
.Pp
.Fn deflateParams
returns
.Dv Z_OK
if successful,
.Dv Z_STREAM_ERROR
if the source stream state was inconsistent or if a parameter was invalid, or
.Dv Z_BUF_ERROR
if strm-\*(Gtavail_out was zero.
.It Xo
.Ft int
.Fn deflateTune "z_streamp strm" "int good_length" "int max_lazy" "int nice_length" "int max_chain"
.Xc
.Pp
Fine tune
.Fn deflate Ns 's
internal compression parameters.
This should only be used by someone who understands the algorithm
used by zlib's deflate for searching for the best matching string,
and even then only by the most fanatic optimizer
trying to squeeze out the last compressed bit for their specific input data.
Read the
.Pa deflate.c
source code for the meaning of the
.Fa max_lazy ,
.Fa good_length ,
.Fa nice_length ,
and
.Fa max_chain
parameters.
.Pp
.Fn deflateTune
can be called after
.Fn deflateInit
or
.Fn deflateInit2 ,
and returns
.Dv Z_OK
on success, or
.Dv Z_STREAM_ERROR
for an invalid deflate stream.
.It Xo
.Ft uLong
.Fn deflateBound "z_streamp strm" "uLong sourceLen"
.Xc
.Pp
.Fn deflateBound
returns an upper bound on the compressed size after deflation of
.Fa sourceLen
bytes.
It must be called after
.Fn deflateInit
or
.Fn deflateInit2 ,
and after
.Fn deflateSetHeader ,
if used. This would be used to allocate an output buffer for deflation in a
single pass, and so would be called before
.Fn deflate .
If that first
.Fn deflate
call is provided the
sourceLen input bytes, an output buffer allocated to the size returned by
.Fn deflateBound ,
and the flush value
.Dv Z_FINISH, then
.Fn deflate
is guaranteed to return
.Dv Z_STREAM_END .
Note that it is possible for the compressed size to be larger than the value
returned by
.Fn deflateBound
if flush options other than
.Dv Z_FINISH
or
.Dv Z_NO_FLUSH
are used.
.It Xo
.Ft int
.Fn deflatePending "z_streamp strm" "unsigned *pending" "int *bits"
.Xc
.Pp
.Fn deflatePending
returns the number of bytes and bits of output that have been generated, but
not yet provided in the available output. The bytes not provided would be due
to the available output space having being consumed. The number of bits of
output not provided are between 0 and 7, where they await more bits to join
them in order to fill out a full byte. If pending or bits are
.Dv Z_NULL, then those values are not set.
.Pp
deflatePending returns
.Dv Z_OK
if success, or
.Dv Z_STREAM_ERROR
if the source stream state was inconsistent.
.It Xo
.Ft int
.Fn deflatePrime "z_streamp strm" "int bits" "int value"
.Xc
.Pp
.Fn deflatePrime
inserts
.Fa bits
in the deflate output stream.
The intent is that this function is used to start off the deflate output
with the bits leftover from a previous deflate stream when appending to it.
As such, this function can only be used for raw deflate,
and must be used before the first
.Fn deflate
call after a
.Fn deflateInit2
or
.Fn deflateReset .
.Fa bits
must be less than or equal to 16,
and that many of the least significant bits of
.Fa value
will be inserted in the output.
.Pp
.Fn deflatePrime
returns
.Dv Z_OK
if successful,
.Dv Z_BUF_ERROR
if there was not enough room in the internal buffer to insert the bits, or
.Dv Z_STREAM_ERROR
if the source stream state was inconsistent.
.It Xo
.Ft int
.Fn deflateSetHeader "z_streamp strm" "gz_headerp head"
.Xc
.Pp
.Fn deflateSetHeader
provides gzip header information for when a gzip
stream is requested by
.Fn deflateInit2 .
.Fn deflateSetHeader
may be called after
.Fn deflateInit2
or
.Fn deflateReset
and before the first call of
.Fn deflate .
The text, time, os, extra field, name, and comment information
in the provided gz_header structure are written to the gzip header
.Po
xflag is ignored \- the extra flags are set according to the compression level.
.Pc
The caller must assure that, if not
.Dv Z_NULL ,
.Va name
and
.va comment
are terminated with a zero byte,
and that if
.Va extra
is not
.Dv Z_NULL ,
that
.Va extra_len
bytes are available there.
If hcrc is true, a gzip header CRC is included.
Note that the current versions of the command-line version of
.Xr gzip 1
do not support header CRCs, and will report that it is a
.Dq multi-part gzip file
and give up.
.Pp
If
.Fn deflateSetHeader
is not used, the default gzip header has text false,
the time set to zero, and os set to 255, with no extra, name, or comment
fields.
The gzip header is returned to the default state by
.Fn deflateReset .
.Pp
.Fn deflateSetHeader
returns
.Dv Z_OK
if successful, or
.Dv Z_STREAM_ERROR
if the source stream state was inconsistent.
.It Xo
.Ft int
.Fn inflateInit2 "z_streamp strm" "int windowBits" ;
.Xc
.Pp
This is another version of
.Fn inflateInit
with an extra parameter.
The fields
.Va next_in ,
.Va avail_in ,
.Va zalloc ,
.Va zfree ,
and
.Va opaque
must be initialized before by the caller.
.Pp
The
.Fa windowBits
parameter is the base two logarithm of the maximum window size
.Pq the size of the history buffer .
It should be in the range 8..15 for this version of the library.
The default value is 15 if
.Fn inflateInit
is used instead.
.Fa windowBits
must be greater than or equal to the
.Fa windowBits
value provided to
.Fn deflateInit2
while compressing, or it must be equal to 15 if
.Fn deflateInit2
was not used.
If a compressed stream with a larger window size is given as input,
.Fn inflate
will return with the error code
.Dv Z_DATA_ERROR
instead of trying to allocate a larger window.
.Pp
.Fa windowBits
can also be zero to request that inflate use the window size in the zlib header
of the compressed stream.
.Pp
.Fa windowBits
can also be \-8..\-15 for raw inflate.
In this case, -windowBits determines the window size.
.Fn inflate
will then process raw deflate data, not looking for a zlib or gzip header,
not generating a check value, and not looking for any check values
for comparison at the end of the stream.
This is for use with other formats that use the deflate compressed data format
such as zip.
Those formats provide their own check values.
If a custom format is developed using the raw deflate format
for compressed data, it is recommended that a check value such as an Adler-32
or a crc32 be applied to the uncompressed data as is done in the zlib, gzip,
and zip formats.
For most applications, the zlib format should be used as is.
Note that comments above on the use in
.Fn deflateInit2
applies to the magnitude of
.Fa windowBits .
.Pp
.Fa windowBits
can also be greater than 15 for optional gzip decoding.
Add 32 to windowBits to enable zlib and gzip decoding with automatic header
detection, or add 16 to decode only the gzip format
.Po
the zlib format will return a
.Dv Z_DATA_ERROR
.Pc .
If a gzip stream is being decoded,
strm-\*(Gtadler is a crc32 instead of an adler32.
.Pp
.Fn inflateInit2
returns
.Dv Z_OK
if successful,
.Dv Z_MEM_ERROR
if there was not enough memory,
.Dv Z_VERSION_ERROR
if the zlib library version is incompatible with the version assumed by the
caller, or
.Dv Z_STREAM_ERROR
if the parameters are invalid, such as a null pointer to the structure.
.Va msg
is set to null if there is no error message.
.Fn inflateInit2
does not perform any decompression apart from reading the
.Nm zlib
header if present: actual decompression will be done by
.Fn inflate .
.Po
So
.Va next_in
and
.Va avail_in
may be modified, but
.Va next_out
and
.Va avail_out
are unused and unchanged.
.Pc
The current implementation of
.Fn inflateInit2
does not process any header information -- that is deferred until
.Fn inflate
is called.
.It Xo
.Ft int
.Fn inflateSetDictionary "z_streamp strm" "const Bytef *dictionary" "uInt dictLength" ;
.Xc
.Pp
Initializes the decompression dictionary from the given uncompressed byte
sequence.
This function must be called immediately after a call to
.Fn inflate
if that call returned
.Dv Z_NEED_DICT .
The dictionary chosen by the compressor can be determined from the
Adler-32 value returned by that call to
.Fn inflate .
The compressor and decompressor must use exactly the same dictionary
.Po
see
.Fn deflateSetDictionary
.Pc .
For raw inflate, this function can be called at any time to set the dictionary.
If the provided dictionary is smaller than the window and there is already data
in the window, then the provided dictionary will amend what's there. The
application must ensure that the dictionary that was used for compression is
provided.
.Pp
.Fn inflateSetDictionary
returns
.Dv Z_OK
if successful,
.Dv Z_STREAM_ERROR
if a parameter is invalid
.Po
e.g. dictionary being
.Dv Z_NULL
.Pc
or the stream state is inconsistent,
.Dv Z_DATA_ERROR
if the given dictionary doesn't match the expected one
.Pq incorrect Adler-32 value .
.Fn inflateSetDictionary
does not perform any decompression: this will be done by subsequent calls of
.Fn inflate .
.It Xo
.Ft int
.Fn inflateGetDictionary "z_streamp strm" "Bytef *dictionary" "uInt *dictLength" ;
.Xc
.Pp
Returns the sliding dictionary being maintained by inflate. dictLength is set
to the number of bytes in the dictionary, and that many bytes are copied to
dictionary. dictionary must have enough space, where 32768 bytes is always
enough. If
.Fn inflateGetDictionary
is called with dictionary equal to
.Dv Z_NULL ,
then only the dictionary length is returned, and nothing is copied.
Similary, if dictLength is
.Dv Z_NULL, then it is not set.
.Pp
.Fn inflateGetDictionary
returns
.Dv Z_OK on success, or
.Cv Z_STREAM_ERROR
if the stream state is inconsistent.
.It Xo

Skips invalid compressed data until a possible full flush point
.Po
see above for the description of
.Fn deflate

.Pc
can be found, or until all available input is skipped.
No output is provided.
.Pp
.Fn inflateSync
searches for a 00 00 FF FF pattern in the compressed data. All full flush
points have this pattern, but not all occurrences of this pattern are full
flush points.
.Pp
.Fn inflateSync
returns
.Dv Z_OK
if a possible full flush point has been found,
.Dv Z_BUF_ERROR
if no more input was provided,
.Dv Z_DATA_ERROR
if no flush point has been found, or
.Dv Z_STREAM_ERROR
if the stream structure was inconsistent.
In the success case, the application may save the current value of
.Va total_in
which indicates where valid compressed data was found.
In the error case, the application may repeatedly call
.Fn inflateSync ,
providing more input each time, until success or end of the input data.
.It Xo

.Fn inflateCopy "z_streamp dest" "z_streamp source"
.Xc
.Pp
Sets the destination stream as a complete copy of the source stream.
.Pp
This function can be useful when randomly accessing a large stream.
The first pass through the stream can periodically record the inflate state,
allowing restarting inflate at those points when randomly accessing the stream.
.Pp
.Fn inflateCopy
returns

This function is the same as
.Fn inflateReset ,
but it also permits changing the wrap and window size requests. The
.Fa windowBits
parameter is interpreted the same as it is for
.Fn inflateInit2 .
.Pp
.Fn inflateReset2
returns
.Dv Z_OK
if success, or
.Dv Z_STREAM_ERROR
if the source stream state was inconsistent
.Po
such as

.It Xo
.Ft int
.Fn inflatePrime "z_stream strm" "int bits" "int value"
.Xc
.Pp
This function inserts bits in the inflate input stream.
The intent is that this function is used
to start inflating at a bit position in the middle of a byte.
The provided bits will be used before any bytes are used from
.Va next_in .
This function should only be used with raw inflate,
and should be used before the first
.Fn inflate
call after
.Fn inflateInit2
or
.Fn inflateReset .
.Fa bits
must be less than or equal to 16,
and that many of the least significant bits of value
will be inserted in the input.
.Pp
If
.Fa bits
is negative, then the input stream bit buffer is emptied. Then
.Fn inflatePrime
can be called again to put bits in the buffer. This is used to clear out bits
leftover after feeding inflate a block description prior to feeding inflate
codes.
.Pp
.Fn inflatePrime

.Dv Z_OK
if successful, or
.Dv Z_STREAM_ERROR
if the source stream state was inconsistent.
.It Xo
.Ft long
.Fn inflateMark "z_streamp strm"
.Xc
.Pp
This function returns two values, one in the lower 16 bits of the return
value, and the other in the remaining upper bits, obtained by shifting the
return value down 16 bits. If the upper value is \-1 and the lower value is
zero, then
.Fn inflate
is currently decoding information outside of a block. If the upper value is \-1
and the lower value is non-zero, then inflate is in the middle of a stored
block, with the lower value equaling the number of bytes from the input
remaining to copy. If the upper value is not \-1, then it is the number of bits
back from the current bit position in the input of the code
.Pq literal or length/distance pair
currently being processed. In that case the lower value is the number of bytes
already emitted for that code.
.Pp
A code is being processed if inflate is waiting for more input to complete
decoding of the code, or if it has completed decoding but is waiting for
more output space to write the literal or match data.
.Pp
.Fn inflateMark
is used to mark locations in the input data for random access, which may be at
bit positions, and to note those cases where the output of a code may span
boundaries of random access blocks. The current location in the input stream
can be determined from
.Va avail_in
and
.Va data_type
as noted in the description for the
.Dv Z_BLOCK
flush parameter for inflate.
.Pp
.Fn inflateMark
returns the value noted above or \-1 << 16 if the provided
source stream state was inconsistent.
.It Xo
.Ft int
.Fn inflateGetHeader "z_streamp strm" "gz_headerp head"
.Xc
.Pp
.Fn inflateGetHeader
requests that gzip header information be stored in the
provided gz_header structure.
.Fn inflateGetHeader
may be called after
.Fn inflateInit2
or
.Fn inflateReset ,
and before the first call of
.Fn inflate .
As
.Fn inflate
processes the gzip stream, head-\*(Gtdone is zero until the header
is completed, at which time head-\*(Gtdone is set to one.
If a zlib stream is being decoded,
then head-\*(Gtdone is set to \-1 to indicate that there will be
no gzip header information forthcoming.
Note that
.Dv Z_BLOCK
or
.Dv Z_TREES
can be used to force
.Fn inflate
to return immediately after header processing is complete
and before any actual data is decompressed.
.Pp
The text, time, xflags, and os fields are filled in with the gzip header
contents.
hcrc is set to true if there is a header CRC.
.Pq The header CRC was valid if done is set to one.
If extra is not
.Dv Z_NULL ,
then
.Va extra_max
contains the maximum number of bytes to write to
.Va extra .
Once done is true,
.Va extra_len
contains the actual extra field length, and
.Va extra
contains the extra field, or that field truncated if
.Va extra_max
is less than
.Va extra_len .
If name is not
.Dv Z_NULL ,
then up to
.Va name_max
characters are written there,
terminated with a zero unless the length is greater than
.Va name_max .
If comment is not
.Dv Z_NULL ,
then up to
.Va comm_max
characters are written there,
terminated with a zero unless the length is greater than
.Va comm_max .
When any of extra, name, or comment are not
.Dv Z_NULL
and the respective field is not present in the header,
then that field is set to
.Dv Z_NULL
to signal its absence.
This allows the use of
.Fn deflateSetHeader
with the returned structure to duplicate the header.
However if those fields are set to allocated memory,
then the application will need to save those pointers
elsewhere so that they can be eventually freed.
.Pp
If
.Fn inflateGetHeader
is not used, then the header information is simply discarded.
The header is always checked for validity,
including the header CRC if present.
.Fn inflateReset
will reset the process to discard the header information.
The application would need to call
.Fn inflateGetHeader
again to retrieve the header from the next gzip stream.
.Pp
.Fn inflateGetHeader
returns
.Dv Z_OK
if successful,

.Dv Z_STREAM_ERROR
if the source stream state was inconsistent.

must be initialized before the call.
If
.Va zalloc
and
.Va zfree
are
.Dv Z_NULL ,
then the default library-derived memory allocation routines are used.
.Fa windowBits
is the base two logarithm of the window size, in the range 8..15.
.Fa window
is a caller supplied buffer of that size.
Except for special applications where it is assured that
.Fn deflate
was used with small window sizes,
.Fa windowBits
must be 15 and a 32K byte window must be supplied to be able to decompress
general deflate streams.
.Pp
See
.Fn inflateBack
for the usage of these routines.
.Pp
.Fn inflateBackInit
will return
.Dv Z_OK
on success,
.Dv Z_STREAM_ERROR
if any of the parameters are invalid,
.Dv Z_MEM_ERROR
if the internal state could not be allocated, or
.Dv Z_VERSION_ERROR
if the version of the library does not match the version of the header file.
.It Xo
.Ft int
.Fn inflateBack "z_stream *strm" "in_func in" "void FAR *in_desc" "out_func out" "void FAR *out_desc"
.Xc
.Pp
.Fn inflateBack
does a raw inflate with a single call using a call-back interface for input and
output. This is potentially more efficient than
.Fn inflate
for file I/O applications, in that it avoids copying between the output and the
sliding window by simply making the window itself the output buffer.
.Fn inflate
can be faster on modern CPUs when used with large buffers.
.Fn inflateBack
trusts the application to not change the output buffer passed by
the output function, at least until
.Fn inflateBack
returns.
.Pp
.Fn inflateBackInit
must be called first to allocate the internal state
and to initialize the state with the user-provided window buffer.
.Fn inflateBack
may then be used multiple times to inflate a complete, raw
deflate stream with each call.
.Fn inflateBackEnd
is then called to free the allocated state.
.Pp
A raw deflate stream is one with no zlib or gzip header or trailer.
This routine would normally be used in a utility that reads zip or gzip
files and writes out uncompressed files.
The utility would decode the header and process the trailer on its own,
hence this routine expects only the raw deflate stream to decompress.
This is different from the normal behavior of
.Fn inflate ,
which expects either a zlib or gzip header and
trailer around the deflate stream.
.Pp
.Fn inflateBack
uses two subroutines supplied by the caller that are then called by
.Fn inflateBack
for input and output.
.Fn inflateBack
calls those routines until it reads a complete deflate stream and writes out
all of the uncompressed data, or until it encounters an error.
The function's parameters and return types are defined above in the
in_func and out_func typedefs.
.Fn inflateBack
will call in(in_desc, &buf) which should return the
number of bytes of provided input, and a pointer to that input in
.Va buf .
If there is no input available,
.Fn in
must return zero \(em buf is ignored in that case \(em and
.Fn inflateBack
will return a buffer error.
.Fn inflateBack
will call out(out_desc, buf, len) to write the uncompressed data buf[0..len\-1].
.Fn out
should return zero on success, or non-zero on failure.
If
.Fn out
returns non-zero,
.Fn inflateBack
will return with an error.
Neither
.Fn in
nor
.Fn out
are permitted to change the contents of the window provided to
.Fn inflateBackInit ,
which is also the buffer that
.Fn out
uses to write from.
The length written by
.Fn out
will be at most the window size.
Any non-zero amount of input may be provided by
.Fn in .
.Pp
For convenience,
.Fn inflateBack
can be provided input on the first call by setting strm-\*(Gtnext_in
and strm-\*(Gtavail_in.
If that input is exhausted, then
.Fn in
will be called.
Therefore strm-\*(Gtnext_in must be initialized before calling
.Fn inflateBack .
If strm-\*(Gtnext_in is
.Dv Z_NULL ,
then
.Fn in
will be called immediately for input.
If strm-\*(Gtnext_in is not
.Dv Z_NULL ,
then strm-\*(Gtavail_in must also be initialized,
and then if strm-\*(Gtavail_in is not zero,
input will initially be taken from
strm-\*(Gtnext_in[0 .. strm-\*(Gtavail_in \- 1].
.Pp
The
.Fa in_desc
and
.Fa out_desc
parameters of
.Fn inflateBack
are passed as the first parameter of
.Fn in
and
.Fn out
respectively when they are called.
These descriptors can be optionally used to pass any information that the
caller-supplied
.Fn in
and
.Fn out
functions need to do their job.
.Pp
On return,
.Fn inflateBack
will set strm-\*(Gtnext_in and strm-\*(Gtavail_in to pass back any unused input
that was provided by the last
.Fn in
call.
The return values of
.Fn inflateBack
can be
.Dv Z_STREAM_END
on success,
.Dv Z_BUF_ERROR
if
.Fn in
or
.Fn out
returned an error,
.Dv Z_DATA_ERROR
if there was a format error in the deflate stream
.Pq in which case strm-\*(Gtmsg is set to indicate the nature of the error ,
or
.Dv Z_STREAM_ERROR
if the stream was not properly initialized.
In the case of
.Dv Z_BUF_ERROR ,
an input or output error can be distinguished using strm-\*(Gtnext_in which
will be
.Dv Z_NULL
only if
.Fn in
returned an error.
If strm-\*(Gtnext_in is not
.Dv Z_NULL ,
then the
.Dv Z_BUF_ERROR
was due to
.Fn out
returning non-zero.
.Po
in() will always be called before out(),
so strm-\*(Gtnext_in is assured to be defined if out() returns non-zero.

Note that
.Fn inflateBack
cannot return
.Dv Z_OK .

.Sh UTILITY FUNCTIONS
The following utility functions are implemented on top of the
basic stream-oriented functions.
To simplify the interface,
some default options are assumed
.Pq compression level and memory usage, standard memory allocation functions .
The source code of these utility functions can be modified
if you need special options.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo
.Ft int
.Fn compress "Bytef *dest" "uLongf *destLen" "const Bytef *source" "uLong sourceLen" ;
.Xc
.Pp
The
.Fn compress
function compresses the source buffer into the destination buffer.
.Fa sourceLen
is the byte length of the source buffer.
Upon entry,
.Fa destLen
is the total size of the destination buffer,
which must be at least the value returned by
.Fn compressBound sourcelen .
Upon exit,
.Fa destLen
is the actual size of the compressed buffer.
.Pp
.Fn compress
returns
.Dv Z_OK
if successful,
.Dv Z_MEM_ERROR
if there was not enough memory, or
.Dv Z_BUF_ERROR
if there was not enough room in the output buffer.
.It Xo
.Ft int
.Fn compress2 "Bytef *dest" "uLongf *destLen" "const Bytef *source" "uLong sourceLen" "int level" ;
.Xc
.Pp
The
.Fn compress2
function compresses the source buffer into the destination buffer.
The
.Fa level
parameter has the same meaning as in
.Fn deflateInit .
.Fa sourceLen
is the byte length of the source buffer.
Upon entry,
.Fa destLen
is the total size of the destination buffer,
which must be at least the value returned by
.Fn compressBound sourceLen .
Upon exit,
.Fa destLen
is the actual size of the compressed buffer.
.Pp
.Fn compress2
returns
.Dv Z_OK
if successful,
.Dv Z_MEM_ERROR
if there was not enough memory,
.Dv Z_BUF_ERROR
if there was not enough room in the output buffer, or
.Dv Z_STREAM_ERROR
if the level parameter is invalid.
.It Xo
.Ft int
.Fn compressBound "uLong sourceLen"
.Xc
.Pp
.Fn compressBound
returns an upper bound on the compressed size after
.Fn compress
or
.Fn compress2
on
.Fa sourceLen
bytes.
It would be used before a
.Fn compress
or
.Fn compress2
call to allocate the destination buffer.
.It Xo
.Ft int
.Fn uncompress "Bytef *dest" "uLongf *destLen" "const Bytef *source" "uLong sourceLen" ;
.Xc
.Pp
The
.Fn uncompress
function decompresses the source buffer into the destination buffer.
.Fa sourceLen
is the byte length of the source buffer.
Upon entry,
.Fa destLen
is the total size of the destination buffer,
which must be large enough to hold the entire uncompressed data.
.Po
The size of the uncompressed data must have been saved previously
by the compressor and transmitted to the decompressor
by some mechanism outside the scope of this compression library.
.Pc
Upon exit,
.Fa destLen
is the actual size of the uncompressed buffer.
.Pp
.Fn uncompress
returns
.Dv Z_OK
if successful,
.Dv Z_MEM_ERROR
if there was not enough memory,
.Dv Z_BUF_ERROR
if there was not enough room in the output buffer, or
.Dv Z_DATA_ERROR
if the input data was corrupted or incomplete. In the case where there is not
enough room,
.Fn uncompress
will fill the output buffer with the uncompressed data up to that point.

.Sh GZIP FILE ACCESS FUNCTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo
.Ft gzFile
.Fn gzopen "const char *path" "const char *mode" ;
.Xc
.Pp
The
.Fn gzopen
function opens a gzip
.Pq .gz
file for reading or writing.
The mode parameter is as in
.Xr fopen 3
.Po
.Qq rb
or
.Qq wb
.Pc
but can also include a compression level
.Pq "wb9"
or a strategy:
.Sq f
for filtered data, as in
.Qq wb6f ;
.Sq h
for Huffman-only compression, as in
.Qq wb1h ,
.Sq R
for run-length encoding as in
.Qq wb1R
or
.Sq F
for fixed code compression as in
.Qq wb9F .
.Po
See the description of
.Fn deflateInit2
for more information about the strategy parameter.
.Pc
.Sq T
will request transparent writing or appending with no compression and not using
the gzip format.
.Pp
.Qq a
can be used instead of
.Qq w
to request that the gzip stream that will be written be appended to the file.
.Qq +
will result in an error, since reading and writing to the same gzip file is not
supported. The addition of
.Qq x
when writing will create the file exclusively, which fails if the file already
exists. On systems that support it, the addition of
.Qq e
when reading or writing will set the flag to close the file on an
.Xr execve 2
call.
.Pp
These functions, as well as gzip, will read and decode a sequence of gzip
streams in a file. The append function of
.Fn gzopen
can be used to create such a file.
.Po
Also see
.Fn gzflush
for another way to do this.
.Pc
When appending,
.Fn gzopen
does not test whether the file begins with a gzip stream, nor does it look for
the end of the gzip streams to begin appending.
.Fn gzopen
will simply append a gzip stream to the existing file.
.Pp
.Fn gzopen
can be used to read a file which is not in gzip format; in this case
.Fn gzread
will directly read from the file without decompression. When reading, this will
be detected automatically by looking for the magic two-byte gzip header.
.Pp
.Fn gzopen
returns
.Dv NULL
if the file could not be opened, if there was insufficient memory to allocate
the gzFile state, or if an invalid mode was specified
.Po
an
.Sq r ,
.Sq w ,
or
.Sq a
was not provided, or
.Sq +
was provided
.Pc .
errno can be checked to determine if the reason gzopen failed was that the file
could not be opened.
.It Xo
.Ft gzFile
.Fn gzdopen "int fd" "const char *mode" ;
.Xc
.Pp
The
.Fn gzdopen
function associates a gzFile with the file descriptor
.Fa fd .
File descriptors are obtained from calls like
.Xr open 2 ,
.Xr dup 2 ,
.Xr creat 3 ,
.Xr pipe 2 ,
or
.Xr fileno 3
.Po
if the file has been previously opened with
.Xr fopen 3
.Pc .
The
.Fa mode
parameter is as in
.Fn gzopen .
.Pp
The next call to
.Fn gzclose
on the returned gzFile will also close the file descriptor fd, just like
fclose(fdopen(fd, mode)) closes the file descriptor fd. If you want to keep fd
open, use fd = dup(fd_keep); gz = gzdopen(fd, mode);. The duplicated descriptor
should be saved to avoid a leak, since
.Fn gzdopen
does not close fd if it fails. If you are using
.Xr fileno 3
to get the file descriptor from a FILE *, then you will have to use
.Xr dup 2
to avoid double-closeing the file descriptor. Both
.Fn gzclose
and
.Xr fclose 3
will close the associated file descriptor, so they need to have different file
descriptors.
.Pp
.Fn gzdopen
returns
.Dv NULL
if there was insufficient memory to allocate the gzFile state,
if an invalid mode was specified
.Po
an
.Sq r ,
.Sq w ,
or
.Sq a
was not provided, or
.Sq +
was provided
.Pc ,
or if fd is \-1. The file descriptor is not used until the next
gz* read, write, seek, or close operation, so
.Fn gzdopen
will not detect if fd is invalid
.Pq unless fd is \-1 .
.It Xo
.Ft int
.Fn gzbuffer "gzFile file" "unsigned size"
.Xc
.Pp
Set the internal buffer size used by this library's functions. The default
buffer size is 8192 bytes. This function must be called after
.Fn gzopen
or
.Fn gzdopen ,
and before any other calls that read or write the file. The buffer memory
allocation is always deferred to the first read or write. Two buffers are
allocated, either both of the specified size when writing, or one of the
specified size and the other twice that size when reading. A larger buffer size
of, for example, 64K or 128K bytes will noticeably increase the speed of
decompression
.Pq reading.
.Pp
The new buffer size also affects the maximum length for
.Fn gzprintf .
.Pp
.Fn gzbuffer
returns 0 on success, or \-1 on failure, such as being called too late.
.It Xo
.Ft int
.Fn gzsetparams "gzFile file" "int level" "int strategy" ;
.Xc
.Pp
The
.Fn gzsetparams
function dynamically updates the compression level or strategy.
See the description of
.Fn deflateInit2
for the meaning of these parameters.
.Pp
.Fn gzsetparams
returns
.Dv Z_OK
if successful, or
.Dv Z_STREAM_ERROR
if the file was not opened for writing.
.It Xo
.Ft int
.Fn gzread "gzFile file" "voidp buf" "unsigned len" ;
.Xc
.Pp
The
.Fn gzread
function reads the given number of uncompressed bytes from the compressed file.
If the input file is not in gzip format,
.Fn gzread
copies the given number of bytes into the buffer directly from the file.
.Pp
After reaching the end of a gzip stream in the input,
.Fn gzread
will continue to read, looking for another gzip stream. Any number of gzip
streams may be concatenated in the input file, and will all be decompressed by
.Fn gzread .
If something other than a gzip stream is encountered after a gzip stream, that
remaining trailing garbage is ignored
.Pq and no error is returned .
.Pp
.Fn gzread can be used to read a gzip file that is being concurrently written.
Upon reaching the end of the input,
.Fn gzread will return with the available
data. If the error code returned by gzerror is
.Dv Z_OK
or
.Dv Z_BUF_ERROR ,
then
.Fn gzclearerr
can be used to clear the end of file indicator in order to permit
.Fn gzread
to be tried again.
.Dv Z_OK
indicates that a gzip stream was completed on the last
.Fn gzread.
.Dv Z_BUF_ERROR
indicates that the input file ended in the middle of a gzip stream. Note that
.Fn gzread
does not return \-1 in the event of an incomplete gzip stream. This error is
deferred until
.Fn gzclose ,
which will return
.Dv Z_BUF_ERROR
if the last
.Fn gzread
ended in the middle of a gzip stream. Alternatively,
.Fn gzerror
can be used before gzclose to detect this case.
.Pp
.Fn gzread
returns the number of uncompressed bytes actually read, less than len end of
file, or \-1 for error.
.It Xo
.Ft int
.Fn gzwrite "gzFile file" "voidpc buf" "unsigned len" ;
.Xc
.Pp
The
.Fn gzwrite
function writes the given number of uncompressed bytes into the compressed file.
.Fn gzwrite
returns the number of uncompressed bytes written or 0 in case of error .
.It Xo
.Ft int
.Fn gzprintf "gzFile file" "const char *format" "..." ;
.Xc
.Pp
The
.Fn gzprintf
function converts, formats, and writes the arguments to the compressed file
under control of the format string, as in
.Xr fprintf 3 .
.Fn gzprintf
returns the number of uncompressed bytes actually written, or 0 in case of
error. The number of uncompressed bytes written is limited to 8191, or one
less than the buffer size given to
.Fn gzbuffer .
The caller should make sure that this limit is not exceeded. If it is
exceeded, then
.Fn gzprintf
will return an error
.Pq 0
with nothing written.
In this case, there may also be a buffer overflow
with unpredictable consequences, which is possible only if
.Nm zlib
was compiled with the insecure functions
.Fn sprintf
or
.Fn vsprintf
because the secure
.Fn snprintf
or
.Fn vsnprintf
functions were not available. This can be determined using
.Fn zlibCompileFlags .
.It Xo
.Ft int
.Fn gzputs "gzFile file" "const char *s" ;
.Xc
.Pp
The
.Fn gzputs
function writes the given null-terminated string to the compressed file,
excluding the terminating null character.
.Pp
.Fn gzputs
returns the number of characters written, or \-1 in case of error.
.It Xo
.Ft char *
.Fn gzgets "gzFile file" "char *buf" "int len" ;
.Xc
.Pp
The
.Fn gzgets
function reads bytes from the compressed file until len\-1 characters are read,
or a newline character is read and transferred to
.Fa buf ,
or an end-of-file condition is encountered. If any characters are read or if
len == 1, the string is terminated with a null character. If no characters are
read due to an end-of-file or len < 1, then the buffer is left untouched.
.Pp
.Fn gzgets
returns
.Fa buf
which is a null-terminated string, or it returns NULL for end-of-file or in
case of error. If there was an error, the contents at buf are indeterminate.
.It Xo
.Ft int
.Fn gzputc "gzFile file" "int c" ;
.Xc
.Pp
The
.Fn gzputc
function writes
.Fa c ,
converted to an unsigned char, into the compressed file.
.Fn gzputc
returns the value that was written, or \-1 in case of error.
.It Xo
.Ft int
.Fn gzgetc "gzFile file" ;
.Xc
.Pp
The
.Fn gzgetc
function reads one byte from the compressed file.
.Fn gzgetc
returns this byte or \-1 in case of end of file or error. This is implemented
as a macro for speed. As such, it does not do all of the checking the other
functions do. I.e. it does not check to see if file is
.Dv NULL ,
nor whether the structure file points to has been clobbered or not.
.It Xo
.Ft int
.Fn gzungetc "int c" "gzFile file"
.Xc
.Pp
Push one character back onto the stream to be read as the first character on
the next read. At least one character of push-back is allowed.
.Fn gzungetc
returns the character pushed, or \-1 on failure.
.Fn gzungetc
will fail if c is \-1, and may fail if a character has been pushed but not read
yet. If
.Fn gzungetc
is used immediately after
.Fn gzopen
or
.Fn gzdopen ,
at least the output buffer size of pushed characters is allowed.
.Po
See
.Fn gzbuffer
above.
.Pc
The pushed character will be discarded if the stream is repositioned
with
.Fn gzseek
or
.Fn gzrewind .
.It Xo
.Ft int
.Fn gzflush "gzFile file" "int flush" ;
.Xc
.Pp
The
.Fn gzflush
function flushes all pending output into the compressed file.
The parameter
.Fa flush
is as in the
.Fn deflate
function.
The return value is the
.Nm zlib
error number
.Po
see function
.Fn gzerror
below
.Pc .
.Fn gzflush
is only permitted when writing. If the flush parameter is
.Dv Z_FINISH ,
the remaining data is written and the gzip stream is completed in the output.
If
.Fn gzwrite
is called again, a new gzip stream will be started in the output.
.Fn gzread
is able to read such concatented gzip streams.
.Pp
.Fn gzflush
should be called only when strictly necessary because it will degrade
compression if called too often.
.It Xo
.Ft z_off_t
.Fn gzseek "gzFile file" "z_off_t offset" "int whence" ;
.Xc
.Pp
Sets the starting position for the next
.Fn gzread
or
.Fn gzwrite
on the given compressed file.
The offset represents a number of bytes in the uncompressed data stream.
The whence parameter is defined as in
.Xr lseek 2 ;
the value
.Dv SEEK_END
is not supported.
.Pp
If the file is opened for reading, this function is emulated but can be
extremely slow.
If the file is opened for writing, only forward seeks are supported;
.Fn gzseek
then compresses a sequence of zeroes up to the new starting position.
.Pp
.Fn gzseek
returns the resulting offset location as measured in bytes from
the beginning of the uncompressed stream, or \-1 in case of error,
in particular if the file is opened for writing and the new starting position
would be before the current position.
.It Xo
.Ft int
.Fn gzrewind "gzFile file" ;
.Xc
.Pp
The
.Fn gzrewind
function rewinds the given
.Fa file .
This function is supported only for reading.
.Pp
gzrewind(file) is equivalent to (int)gzseek(file, 0L, SEEK_SET).
.It Xo
.Ft z_off_t
.Fn gztell "gzFile file" ;
.Xc
.Pp
The
.Fn gztell
function returns the starting position for the next
.Fn gzread
or
.Fn gzwrite
on the given compressed file. This position represents a number of bytes in
the uncompressed data stream, and is zero when starting, even if appending or
reading a gzip stream from the middle of a file using
.Fn gzdopen .
.Pp
gztell(file) is equivalent to gzseek(file, 0L, SEEK_CUR).
.It Xo
.Ft z_off_t
.Fn gzoffset "gzFile file"
.Xc
.Pp
Returns the current offset in the file being read or written. This offset
includes the count of bytes that precede the gzip stream, for example when
appending or when using
.Fn gzdopen
for reading. When reading, the offset does not include as yet unused buffered
input. This information can be used for a progress indicator. On error,
.Fn gzoffset
returns \-1.
.It Xo
.Ft int
.Fn gzeof "gzFile file" ;
.Xc
.Pp
The
.Fn gzeof
function returns
true
.Pq 1
if the end-of-file indicator
has been set while reading, false
.Pq 0
otherwise. Note that the end-of-file indicator is set only if the read tried
to go past the end of the input, but came up short. Therefore, just like
.Xr feof 3 Ns ,
.Fn gzeof
may return false even if there is no more data to read, in the event that the
last read request was for the exact number of bytes remaining in the input
file. This will happen if the input file size is an exact multiple of the
buffer size.
.Pp
If
.Fn gzeof
returns true, then the read functions will return no more data, unless the
end-of-file indicator is reset by
.Fn gzclearerr
and the input file has grown since the previous end of file was detected.
.It Xo
.Ft int
.Fn gzdirect "gzFile file" ;
.Xc
.Pp
The
.Fn gzdirect
function returns true
.Pq 1
if the file is being copied directly while reading, or false
.Pq 0
if file is a gzip stream being decompressed.
.Pp
If the input file is empty,
.Fn gzdirect
will return true, since the input does not contain a gzip stream.
.Pp
If
.Fn gzdirect
is used immediately after
.Fn gzopen
or
.Fn gzdopen
it will cause buffers to be allocated to allow reading the file to determine if
it is a gzip file. Therefore if
.Fn gzbuffer
is used, it should be called before
.Fn gzdirect .
.Pp
When writing,
.Fn gzdirect
returns true
.Pq 1
if transparent writing was requested
.Po
.Qq wT
for the
.Fn gzopen
mode
.Pc ,
or false
.Pq 0
otherwise.
.Po
Note:
.Fn gzdirect
is not needed when writing. Transparent writing must be explicitly requested,
so the application already knows the answer. When linking statically, using
.Fn gzdirect
will include all of the zlib code for gzip file reading and decompression,
which may not be desired.
.Pc
.It Xo
.Ft int
.Fn gzclose "gzFile file" ;
.Xc
.Pp
The
.Fn gzclose
function flushes all pending output if necessary, closes the compressed file
and deallocates the (de)compression state. Note that once file is closed, you
cannot call
.Fn gzerror
with file, since its structures have been deallocated.
.Fn gzclose
must not be called more than once on the same file, just as free must not be
called more than once on the same allocation.
.Pp
gzclose will return
.Dv Z_STREAM_ERROR
if file is not valid,
.Dv Z_ERRNO
on a file operation error,
.Dv Z_MEM_ERROR
if out of memory,
.Dv Z_BUF_ERROR
if the last read ended in the middle of a gzip stream, or
.Dv Z_OK
on success.
.It Xo
.Ft int
.Fn gzclose_r "gzFile file"
.br
.Ft int
.Fn gzclose_w "gzFile file"
.Xc
.Pp
Same as
.Fn gzclose ,
but
.Fn gzclose_r
is only for use when reading, and
.Fn gzclose_w
is only for use when writing or appending. The advantage to
using these instead of
.Fn gzclose
is that they avoid linking in zlib compression or decompression code that is
not used when only reading or only writing respectively. If
.Fn gzclose
is used, then both compression and decompression code will be included the
application when linking to a static zlib library.
.It Xo
.Ft const char *
.Fn gzerror "gzFile file" "int *errnum" ;
.Xc
.Pp
The
.Fn gzerror
function returns the error message for the last error which occurred on the
given compressed
.Fa file .
.Fa errnum
is set to the
.Nm zlib
error number.
If an error occurred in the file system and not in the compression library,
.Fa errnum
is set to
.Dv Z_ERRNO
and the application may consult errno to get the exact error code.
.Pp
The application must not modify the returned string. Future calls to this
function may invalidate the previously returned string. If
.Fa file
is closed, then the string previously returned by
.Fn gzerror
will no longer be available.
.Pp
.Fn gzerror
should be used to distinguish errors from end-of-file for those functions above
that do not distinguish those cases in their return values.
.It Xo
.Ft void
.Fn gzclearerr "gzFile file"
.Xc
Clears the error and end-of-file flags for
.Fa file .
This is analogous to the
.Fn clearerr
function in stdio.
This is useful for continuing to read a gzip file
that is being written concurrently.
.El
.Sh CHECKSUM FUNCTIONS
These functions are not related to compression but are exported
anyway because they might be useful in applications using the
compression library.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo
.Ft uLong
.Fn adler32 "uLong adler" "const Bytef *buf" "uInt len" ;
.Xc
The
.Fn adler32
function updates a running Adler-32 checksum with the bytes buf[0..len\-1]
and returns the updated checksum.
If
.Fa buf
is
.Dv Z_NULL ,
this function returns the required initial value for the checksum.
.Pp
An Adler-32 checksum is almost as reliable as a CRC32 but can be computed
much faster.
Usage example:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
uLong adler = adler32(0L, Z_NULL, 0);

while (read_buffer(buffer, length) != EOF) {
adler = adler32(adler, buffer, length);
}
if (adler != original_adler) error();
.Ed
.It Xo
.Ft uLong
.Fn adler32_combine "uLong adler1" "uLong adler2" "z_off_t len2"
.Xc
.Pp
The
.Fn adler32_combine
function combines two Adler-32 checksums into one.
For two sequences of bytes, seq1 and seq2 with lengths len1 and len2,
Adler-32 checksums are calculated for each, adler1 and adler2.
.Fn adler32_combine
returns the Adler-32 checksum of seq1 and seq2 concatenated,
requiring only adler1, adler2, and len2. Note that the
.Vt z_off_t
type 
.Po
like
.Vt off_t
.Pc
is a signed integer. If len2 is negative, the result has no meaning or utility.
.It Xo
.Ft uLong
.Fn crc32 "uLong crc" "const Bytef *buf" "uInt len" ;
.Xc
.Pp
The
.Fn crc32
function updates a running CRC-32 with the bytes buf[0..len\-1]
and returns the updated CRC-32.
If
.Fa buf
is
.Dv Z_NULL ,
this function returns the required initial value for the CRC.
Pre- and post-conditioning
.Pq one's complement
is performed within this function so it shouldn't be done by the application.
Usage example:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
uLong crc = crc32(0L, Z_NULL, 0);

while (read_buffer(buffer, length) != EOF) {
crc = crc32(crc, buffer, length);
}
if (crc != original_crc) error();
.Ed
.It Xo
.Ft uLong
.Fn crc32_combine "uLong crc1" "uLong crc2" "z_off_t len2"
.Xc
.Pp
The
.Fn crc32_combine
function combines two CRC-32 check values into one.
For two sequences of bytes,
seq1 and seq2 with lengths len1 and len2,
CRC-32 check values are calculated for each, crc1 and crc2.
.Fn crc32_combine
returns the CRC-32 check value of seq1 and seq2 concatenated,
requiring only crc1, crc2, and len2.

The application must update

It must update

The application must initialize

.Pp
The

value provided by the application will be passed as the first
parameter for calls to
.Fn zalloc

.Fn zfree .
This can be useful for custom memory management.
The compression library attaches no meaning to the

If

WARNING: On MSDOS, pointers returned by
